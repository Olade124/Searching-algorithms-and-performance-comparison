# Searching algorithms and performance comparison
This repository includes implementations of linear search, binary search, and a performance comparison on large datasets using Python’s time module. It also features a hash table–based gym shopping list system with linear probing for collision handling. Key functions include inserting, searching, and displaying fitness-related items. The project demonstrates core data structures and algorithm efficiency.
